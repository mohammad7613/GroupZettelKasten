## Critical Questions
Do we have wisdom ? Are we really home sapiens? 

Why have we been so self-destructive in spite of tremendous information and knowledge we gleaned through the history?

What is Wisdom and Power ? What is the role of information in respect to wisdom and power?

Author believe that information is more hero than humanity through the history and it is oxygen of modern life. 

My view which might match the view of author: Information is the fundamental unit of world? 
Therefore, we can not ignore it and it significantly pertain to the problem of wisdom and power ? What should we do at individual level and social level?


## Chapter 1: What is information
Naive View of information: Information has a direct relation with truth. Therefore, the more information connects better to the truth

Evidence: Information reduce child morality



Populist view of information 
Information is power and there is no truth
It is like niche's statement God is dead.

We will explore populism at greater depth in chapter 5, but at this point it
is important to note that populists are eroding trust in large-scale institutions
and international cooperation just when humanity confronts the existential
challenges of ecological collapse, global war, and out-of-control technology.
Instead of trusting complex human institutions, populists give us the same
advice as the Phaethon myth and “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”: “Trust God or
the great sorcerer to intervene and make everything right again.” If we take
this advice, we’ll likely find ourselves in the short term under the thumb of the
worst kind of power-hungry humans, and in the long term under the thumb of new AI overlords.


In Mohammad's view:

Naive view of information seems more like the pure scientific approach toward the truth

Populist view of information seems more like ideology truth even beyond reality(they try to deny reality).

Therefore, the debate between these two views of information is more like the debate between religion and science.


What is the relation between truth and reality ?

truth is a certain aspect of reality to which we give value.  

"Truth is something that brings our attention
to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects. No
account of reality is 100 percent accurate, but some accounts are nevertheless
more truthful than others."

What does information does?

Rather, what information does is to create new
realities by tying together disparate things—whether couples or empires. Its
defining feature is connection rather than representation, and information is
whatever connects different points into a network. Information doesn’t
necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in formation.
Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put
voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military
formations.

What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and
fictions are information, too. Contrary to what the naive view of information
says, information has no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn’t to
represent a preexisting reality.


It should be emphasized that rejecting the naive view of information as
representation does not force us to reject the notion of truth, nor does it force
us to embrace the populist view of information as a weapon. While
information always connects, some types of information—from scientific
books to political speeches—may strive to connect people by accurately
representing certain aspects of reality. But this requires a special effort, which
most information does not make. This is why the naive view is wrong to
believe that creating more powerful information technology will necessarily
result in a more truthful understanding of the world.

My view
Therefore, information can both create power by connecting individuals and connecting different views of reality. Therefore, while we should not deem information as a representation reality(scientific approach, naive view of information, technology is going to help us), we should also not deny the existence of truth and deem information as a weapon to create power. 

We need to use information to connect power to truth in order to create more truthful of reality and direct individuals towards changing the reality in the way it should be. 

Change the reality in the way that truth, as an representation of an aspect of reality, is the accurate representation of the core aspect of reality. That is where science is connected to religion. 
How could we use the ability of information in connecting individuals to reinforce the more truthful of reality. 

Information means asking question and answering question. Which question should be asked and which answer should we connect to that question to move societies in more truthful representation of reality by both changing the representation and even reality(Active inference).




## Chapter 2 and 3 Main Problem
How does information network generate through the history?
the historical development of human
information networks.

It emphasizes more on key dilemmas in creating information network:

how different answers to these dilemmas shaped contrasting human
societies. What we usually think of as ideological and political conflicts often
turn out to be clashes between opposing types of information networks.

Chapters 2 and 3 describe how large-scale information networks—from
ancient kingdoms to present-day states—have relied on both mythmakers and
bureaucrats.

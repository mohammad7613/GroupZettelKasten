## Critical Questions
Do we have wisdom ? Are we really home sapiens? 

Why have we been so self-destructive in spite of tremendous information and knowledge we gleaned through the history?

What is Wisdom and Power ? What is the role of information in respect to wisdom and power?
What is the role of truth and reality towards wisdom?

Author believe that information is more hero than humanity through the history and it is oxygen of modern life. 

My view which might match the view of author: Information is the fundamental unit of world? 
Therefore, we can not ignore it and it significantly pertain to the problem of wisdom and power ? What should we do at the individual level and the social level?


## Chapter 1: What is information
Naive View of information: Information has a direct relation with truth. Therefore, the more information connects better to the truth

Evidence: Information reduce child morality



Populist view of information 
Information is power and there is no truth

We will explore populism at greater depth in chapter 5, but at this point it
is important to note that populists are eroding trust in large-scale institutions
and international cooperation just when humanity confronts the existential
challenges of ecological collapse, global war, and out-of-control technology.
Instead of trusting complex human institutions, populists give us the same
advice as the Phaethon myth and “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”: “Trust God or
the great sorcerer to intervene and make everything right again.” If we take
this advice, we’ll likely find ourselves in the short term under the thumb of the
worst kind of power-hungry humans, and in the long term under the thumb of new AI overlords.

The power to create any kind of reality you want.

In Mohammad's view:

Naive view of information seems more like the pure scientific approach toward the truth

Populist view of information seems more like ideological approach towards truth even beyond reality(they try to deny one reality. They tend to build the reality).

Therefore, the debate between these two views of information is more like the debate between religion and science.


What is the relation between truth and reality ?

truth is a certain aspect of reality to which we give value.  

"Truth is about something that brings our attention
to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects. No
account of reality is 100 percent accurate, but some accounts are nevertheless
more truthful than others."

What does information does?

Rather, what information does is to create new
realities by tying together disparate things—whether couples or empires. Its
defining feature is connection rather than representation, and information is
whatever connects different points into a network. Information doesn’t
necessarily inform us about things. Rather, it puts things in formation.
Horoscopes put lovers in astrological formations, propaganda broadcasts put
voters in political formations, and marching songs put soldiers in military
formations.

What the example of astrology illustrates is that errors, lies, fantasies, and
fictions are information, too. Contrary to what the naive view of information
says, information has no essential link to truth, and its role in history isn’t to
represent a preexisting reality.


It should be emphasized that rejecting the naive view of information as
representation does not force us to reject the notion of truth, nor does it force
us to embrace the populist view of information as a weapon. While
information always connects, some types of information—from scientific
books to political speeches—may strive to connect people by accurately
representing certain aspects of reality. But this requires a special effort, which
most information does not make. This is why the naive view is wrong to
believe that creating more powerful information technology will necessarily
result in a more truthful understanding of the world.

My view
Therefore, information can both create power by connecting individuals and connecting different views of reality. Therefore, while we should not deem information as a representation reality(scientific approach, naive view of information, technology is going to help us), we should also not deny the existence of truth and deem information as a weapon to create power. 

We need to use information to connect power to truth in order to create more truthful of reality and direct individuals towards changing the reality in the way it should be. 

Change the reality in the way that truth, as an representation of an aspect of reality, is the accurate representation of the core aspect of reality. That is where science should be connected to religion. 
How could we use the ability of information in connecting individuals to reinforce the more truthful of reality. 

Information means asking question and answering question. Which question should be asked and which answer should we connect to that question to move societies towards more truthful representation of reality by both changing the representation and even reality(Active inference).




## Chapter 2 and 3 Main Problem
How does information network generate through the history?
the historical development of human
information networks.

It emphasizes more on key dilemmas in creating information network:

how different answers to these dilemmas shaped contrasting human
societies. What we usually think of as ideological and political conflicts often
turn out to be clashes between opposing types of information networks.

Chapters 2 and 3 describe how large-scale information networks—from
ancient kingdoms to present-day states—have relied on both mythmakers and
bureaucrats.


How do stories come together to give rise to history ? 



Chapter 3
The central question of this chapter :
How mythmaker and bureaucrats create a large information network that is the foundation for  nations and societies?

My answer 
mythmaker is like top-down process in Active Inference 
 bureaucrats is like bottom-up process in Active Inference 


Why were stories the first crucial information technology for human cooperation?

Stories allowed humans to cooperate on a large scale, shaping shared identities and motivating collective action.

Evidence: 
The story of group-raped woman 

**Context**: After the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 in the Russian Empire (present-day Moldova), where dozens of Jews were killed and many more assaulted, the Jewish community was shaken.
    
**The Poem**: Bialik, who was sent to Kishinev to document the tragedy, responded with _In the City of Slaughter_. It wasn’t just a lament—it was a searing indictment.
    
    - He criticized Jewish men for **passivity** in the face of violence.
        
    - He framed Jewish suffering not as something to endure silently but as a call for **resistance and renewal**.
        
**Impact**:
    
    - The poem became a rallying cry for the Zionist movement and Jewish self-defense organizations.
        
    - It helped shape a new image of the Jew—not only as a victim, but as someone who could (and must) fight back.
        
    - Later groups, including the Haganah (early Jewish defense force in Palestine), drew inspiration from this spirit.
    - 
- Nations were often imagined first by poets and storytellers before being built by political leaders.
    
- Example: Hayim Nahman Bialik’s poem _In the City of Slaughter_ (1903) inspired Jews to see themselves as victims who needed to defend themselves, contributing to the eventual creation of Israel.
    
- Theodor Herzl’s _The Jewish State_ (1896) and _The Old New Land_ (1902) provided a vision that mobilized the Zionist movement, despite neglecting realities on the ground

- **Context**: Herzl was a Viennese journalist who witnessed growing anti-Semitism in Europe (especially during the Dreyfus Affair in France). He concluded that Jews would never be safe without a sovereign homeland.
    
- **The Jewish State (1896)**:
    
    - A political pamphlet laying out Herzl’s idea that Jews needed a **nation-state of their own**.
        
    - It was a practical vision: a mass migration, supported by Jewish institutions, leading to the establishment of a state.
        
    - The location was debated—Palestine was the dream, but he also floated alternatives (like Argentina).
        
- **The Old New Land (1902)**:
    
    - A utopian novel imagining what the future Jewish homeland might look like.
        
    - Depicted a modern, technologically advanced, and tolerant society in Palestine.
        
    - Famous motto: _“If you will it, it is no dream.”_
        
- **Impact**:
    
    - Herzl’s works did not reflect the full reality on the ground in Ottoman Palestine (he largely ignored Arab inhabitants).
        
    - Still, they gave **a coherent narrative and vision** that mobilized the Zionist movement, inspiring both leaders and ordinary Jews.
        
    - His ideas provided the ideological foundation that turned scattered dreams into a political program.



What are the limitations of stories as an information technology?
Stories are powerful for memory and identity but inadequate for managing complex administrative and technical details.
Stories is higher-level goal which needs lower-level implementation (top-down and bottom-up)


## What technology overcame the limitations of stories?
Written document 

Written documents provided a nonorganic information system capable of storing and transmitting precise, complex, and impersonal data.

## How do stories and documents work together in building human networks?
Stories create meaning and shared identity, while documents enforce order and enable long-term stability.

It likes the balance of top-down and bottom-up.



## How did written documents change the nature of reality in early societies?

Rules and Money Boundaries on the map are realities created by document. 

- A Mesopotamian clay tablet under King Shulgi (2053 BCE) recorded sheep deliveries, making resource tracking possible. Even though the scribe miscalculated (898 vs. 896 animals), the written tally became the “truth” preserved for posterity.
    
- Ownership in oral cultures depended on communal agreement, but with documents, ownership depended on official records, allowing central authorities (not neighbors) to enforce property rights.
    
- In Assyria, loan contracts were “killed” when debts were repaid, showing that documents themselves _were_ the debt, not just its record



## What new problem did the proliferation of documents create?

The problem of retrieval — finding the right document among thousands.
They are not categorized. They are not contextualized.

- Priestess Narâmtani in 1730 BCE Sippar begged a relative to find tablets proving her inheritance claim. Without them, she risked losing her case.
    
- Unlike the human brain, which is highly efficient in retrieval due to evolution, archives had no natural order. People had to invent systems for organizing and locating documents
How was the retrieval problem solved, and what were the consequences?
Categorization


## How was the retrieval problem solved, and what were the consequences?
Bureaucracy was invented to impose artificial order through categorization — but it often sacrificed truth for order.


- Bureaucracy (“rule by writing desk”) divided the world into “drawers” — categories for documents. This principle extended from clay tablets to computer folders.
    
- Official forms force individuals into rigid categories, even if reality doesn’t fit.
    
- Bureaucratic systems pursue narrow goals (e.g., industrial production ignoring pollution) while distorting broader truths

It is like breaking down the main goal to several sub-goals and categorize the information needed for each sub-goal.



## How does bureaucracy affect knowledge and science and distorts realities?

Bureaucracy shapes how we classify the world, sometimes distorting reality but enabling structured knowledge production.

Categorize tasks and prioritize tasks

- Academic disciplines are bureaucratic creations — history, biology, mathematics — even though phenomena like COVID-19 span all three.
    
- Species classification illustrates the problem: evolution resists rigid boundaries, yet scientists must place organisms into drawers like “lion,” “tiger,” or “human.” Hybrid species (ligers, pizzly bears) and gene transfer in bacteria undermine fixed categories.
    
- Even defining “life” (e.g., viruses) is an intersubjective bureaucratic convention, not an objective fact


## If bureaucracy distorts reality, why do we still rely on it?

Because bureaucracy provides order necessary for large-scale cooperation, even at the cost of truth.

Sometime you need to distort reality to achieve a goal 

- Bureaucratic distortions (rigid categories, forms, protocols) are frustrating but essential to organize hospitals, schools, and public services.
    
- Hospitals, for example, are bureaucratic institutions. Despite inefficiencies, their structured departments and hierarchies save lives
-

## What are "biological dramas," and why do they make it so difficult for art and mythology to explain bureaucracy?

"Biological dramas" areprimal storylines rooted in millions of years of evolution—like sibling rivalry, romance, and struggles for dominance—that our brains are wired to understand. Art and mythology rely heavily on these dramas, which are a poor guide for understanding the non-biological, impersonal logic of documents and archives.

We need a revolution in at informational level and story level. Our bottom-up technological tools has been advancing. However, our top-down stories are still fixed. That is why, we there is misalignment between story telling and bureaucracy?  That is why we need to initiate the revolutionary principle at the story level(cognitive niche).



**Ramayana**, is built entirely on biological dramas. Key plotlines include parental abandonment (fear of neglect) , sibling rivalry ("Father loves me more than you") , romantic triangles ("boy fights boy over girl") , and purity versus impurity (the struggle to avoid pollution). These stories are compelling because they tap into evolutionary survival instincts. However, they offer no way to understand how a kingdom actually collects taxes or manages archives. As the text notes, "sibling rivalry and romantic triangles aren't a good guide for the dynamics of documents, which have no siblings and no romantic life." This is why our minds find it much more difficult to understand "death by a document" than death by a tiger.

## What are the dangerous real-world consequences of this failure to understand bureaucracy?

This gap in understanding leads to two harmful outcomes: people either feel helpless and alienated in the face of incomprehensible power, or they conclude that bureaucracy is a malicious conspiracy, leading to violent revolts against the systems and people that run it.


## conclusion
**mythology and bureaucracy are the twin pillars of every large-scale society**. However, there is a fundamental conflict between how these two pillars function. Our minds, shaped by evolution, are primed to understand the world through simple, personal, and emotional "biological dramas" found in our myths. Bureaucracy, in contrast, operates on a complex, impersonal, and documentary logic that we find alien and difficult to trust. This cognitive gap leaves people feeling either powerless against systems they don't understand or prone to violently rejecting them as conspiracies. The failure to bridge this divide poses a constant threat to social order, a challenge that will only become more complex as AI begins to take over the roles of both bureaucrat and mythmaker.

mythology and bureaucracy are like top-down and bottom-up information processing in both perceiving reality and changing reality. Information networks are the result of the interaction between these two twin pillars. But the core problem that these two are misaligned.
